    #Onchange Methods
    '''In many cases, both computed fields and onchanges may be used to achieve the
    same result. Always prefer computed fields since they are also triggered outside
    of the context of a form view. Never ever use an onchange to add business logic
    to your model. This is a very bad idea since onchanges are not automatically
    triggered when creating a record programmatically; they are only triggered in the form view.'''

    The first important detail to note is that our method name isnâ€™t prefixed with an underscore (_).
    This makes our method a public method, which can be called directly from the Odoo interface (through an RPC call).
    Until now, all methods we created (compute, onchange) were called internally, so we used private methods prefixed
    by an underscore. You should always define your methods as private unless they need to be called from the user interface.
